1. We need an annual report that includes:

— Number of each degree done for the previous calendar year for each local body.
— Number of each degree done for the previous calendar year for all of USGL

2. Sponsor reports

— Report that tells total number of minervals a person has sponsored.




- Initiation report could be better
* check box by each person that represents that a cert has been received


* Allow the various dates around initiations to be easily inputted (updating cert dates etc.)
- Put in dates from initiation list?
- add a "today" button on initiation page?


- show initiation count in pickers to better tell?
- show last init taken in picker?


* Allow merging of locations

* allow deleting of entities
 - people can be archived on merge, need to add to person page?

* show unique people sponsored on people list

* show active states in people list (shows where the person is most active)




Other items that I think are already there:
-- Get a list of all officers for X person.



 - maybe better reloading of cache?


separate toPerformLocationId, performedLocationId, submittedThrough?


how many of each degree done in the US in calendar year
