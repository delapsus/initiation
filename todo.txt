1. Make application input pages for all forms

2. Allow person, initiation, and location data to be edited.
 - person done
 - maybe better reloading of cache?

3. Allow the various dates around initiations to be easily inputted (updating cert dates etc.)

4. Allow merging of entities (person, location)

5. allow deleting of entities

Sort order on the people search page

-- Be able to run a report that gives me all apps submitted in the last year that do not have matching ISRs.
This will enable me to be able to catch expired apps, but also send the LB a report showing which ISRs they should be submitting and which apps they should expire.

-- ISRs submitted but no certs submitted. (exception would be minerval). I'd like to run a report that shows which ISRs were submitted without certs.

-- Note that both of those likely have a TON of legacy/old items.
Its not going to be useful for me to know that horizon has 400 "expired" applications etc.
So maybe there's a way to ignore data that is over X old?

Other items that I think are already there:
-- Get a list of all officers for X person.




done:
-- Get a list of people someone sponsored.
-- Get a list of All X degree members
-- Get a list of all initiations at X Body
